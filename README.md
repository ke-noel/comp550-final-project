# COMP550 Final Project: 
## Comparing Extractive Text Summarization Methods Across Languages

**Nakiya Noorbhai, Kira NoÃ«l, Luca Garnier-Lucadie**

We explore the performance of various approaches to extractive text summarization when applied to different languages. The summarizer models are in the folder `summarizers`, and the execution of the experiments and generation of plots are in `main.ipynb`.

### Required Libraries
* `datasets`
* `gensim` (`models` package)
* `matplotlib`
* `networkx`
* `nltk` (`corpus` and `tokenize` packages)
* `numpy`
* `pandas`
